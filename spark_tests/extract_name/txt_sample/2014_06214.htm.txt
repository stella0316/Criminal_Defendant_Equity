	 The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
Darrell Roberts, Appellant.





Lynn W.L. Fahey, New York, N.Y., for appellant.

Kenneth P. Thompson, District Attorney, Brooklyn, N.Y. (Leonard Joblove and Seth
M. Lieberman of counsel; Robert Ho on the memorandum), for respondent.





Appeal by the defendant, as limited by his motion, from a sentence of the Supreme
Court, Kings County (Arriaga, J.), imposed March 26, 2013, on the ground that the
sentence was excessive.

Ordered that the sentence is affirmed.

The defendant's valid waiver of his right to appeal precludes review of his contention
that the sentence imposed was excessive (see People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 264-267 [2011]; People v Lopez, 6 NY3d
248, 255-256 [2006]). Eng, P.J., Balkin, Dickerson, Chambers and Hinds-Radix, JJ.,
concur.
