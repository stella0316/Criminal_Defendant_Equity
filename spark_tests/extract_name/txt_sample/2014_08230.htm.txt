	 The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
Carlos Rivera, Appellant.





Steven Banks, The Legal Aid Society, New York (Joanne Legano Ross of counsel),
for appellant.

Cyrus R. Vance, Jr., District Attorney, New York (Sara M. Zausmer of counsel), for
respondent.



Appeal from judgment, Supreme Court, New York County (Thomas A. Farber, J.),
rendered December 4, 2012, convicting defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of grand
larceny in the fourth degree, and sentencing him to a term of 90 days, concurrent with
five years' probation, unanimously dismissed, as moot.

As the result of a violation of probation, defendant's original sentence was replaced
by a new sentence from which defendant has not appealed, and which he has completed
in any event. Accordingly, this appeal, in which the only claim is that the original
sentence of probation was excessive, is moot. Concur—Gonzalez, P.J., Mazzarelli,
Manzanet-Daniels, Gische and Clark, JJ.
