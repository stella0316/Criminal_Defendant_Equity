	 The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v
Diana Kosty, Appellant.

 


D.J. & J.A. Cirando, Esqs., Syracuse (John A. Cirando of counsel), for
defendant-appellant.

Valerie G. Gardner, District Attorney, Penn Yan (Megan P. Dadd of counsel), for
respondent.





Appeal from a judgment of the Yates County Court (W. Patrick Falvey, J.), rendered
November 13, 2012. The judgment convicted defendant, upon her plea of guilty, of
offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree.

It is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from is unanimously
affirmed.

Memorandum: Defendant appeals from a judgment convicting her upon her plea of
guilty of offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree (Penal Law
§ 175.35). Defendant contends that her waiver of the right to appeal was
invalid because County Court did not explain exceptions to the waiver. We reject that
contention (see People v
Corbin, 121 AD3d 803 [2014]). Defendant's contention that she did not admit to
the element of intent to defraud during her plea is actually a challenge to the factual
sufficiency of the plea allocution, and that challenge is encompassed by her valid waiver
of the right to appeal (see
People v Gardner, 101 AD3d 1634, 1634 [2012]; People v Bailey, 49 AD3d
1258, 1259 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 932 [2008]). In any event, defendant
failed to preserve her contention for our review inasmuch as she failed to move to
withdraw the plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Lewandowski, 82
AD3d 1602, 1602 [2011]), and this case does not fall within the "rare exception to
the preservation rule" (People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 666 [1988]).

Defendant's valid waiver of the right to appeal also encompasses her contention that
the court erred in directing her to pay a specified amount of restitution without
conducting a hearing "inasmuch as that amount was an explicit part of defendant's
agreed-upon plea bargain" (People v Taylor, 70 AD3d 1121, 1122 [2010], lv denied
14 NY3d 845 [2010]; see
People v Wapniewski, 115 AD3d 1251, 1251-1252 [2014], lv denied 23
NY3d 1026 [2014]). In any event, defendant failed to preserve her contention for our
review by challenging the court's determination as to the amount of restitution or by
requesting a hearing on the issue (see People v Giovanni, 53 AD3d 778, 778-779 [2008],
lv denied 11 NY3d 832 [2008]). Defendant also failed to preserve for our review
her contention that the court erred in imposing a collection surcharge of 10% of the
amount of restitution (see CPL 470.05 [2]; People v Kirkland, 105 AD3d 1337, 1338 [2013], lv
denied 21 NY3d 1043 [2013]). We decline to exercise our power to review that
contention as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice (see CPL 470.15 [3]
[c]). Present—Scudder, P.J., Smith, Peradotto, Carni and Sconiers, JJ.
